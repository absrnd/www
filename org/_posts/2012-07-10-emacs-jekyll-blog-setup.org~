* Why create a static website?

After years of creating CMS website for other people, I decided that
this site should be different. A database and 20+ Mb of server-side
code just seems excessive for a scale of site that I ever expect to
create. Plus, I am a tinkerer - I want to edit the html,
write the javascript, tweak the css. I spend my working life in Emacs,
so the question is.. what is the most flexible way that I can create a
website that allows me the maximum amount of flexibility while
providing sufficient templating and modularity to avoid the spagetti
code nightmare that every flat-file static website turned into in the
bad old days?

Once I found out about [[https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/][Jekyll]] - the static website generator used for
GitHub pages - the answer was clear.. Use Emacs org-mode to
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html][publish
html files]], then Jekyll to process the template/markdown and create
the site.

* Create a directory structure

I have create a direcotry in my home directory called www. In this
directory, I have a sub-dir for each project (e.g. ~/www/project1
~/www/project2 etc.). Inside each project direcory you need two
directories - one for the .org files and another to publish the .html
files into. 

In Emacs, you will edit files in the project/org directory,
publish html files to project/html and also run Jekyll in the
this directory.

My directory structure for this site is shown below: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
www
└── absrnd
    ├── html
    │   ├── _includes
    │   ├── _layouts
    │   ├── media
    │   │   └── css
    │   ├── _posts
    │   └── _site
    │       ├── blog
    │       └── media
    │           └── css
    └── org
        ├── media
        │   └── css
        └── _posts

** How to publish a project as HTML

Org-Mode can publish a project in many different formats, including
HTML. To publish, use 

M-x org-publish <project>

Or, when editing an org-mode file, use

C-c C-e X <project>
